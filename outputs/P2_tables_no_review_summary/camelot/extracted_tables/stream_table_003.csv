,due to the social instability created during the national villagization program that led to the,
,resettlement of peasants and abandonment of irrigated lands in the old settlement areas.,
,,Medium and large-scale commercial irrigated farms have started in the Upper and
,"Middle Awash River Basin (Figure 1), which is one of the most intensively developed",
,basins of the country.,
,"Figure 1. Location map, Ethiopia with its major river basins (a) and Awash Basin (b) and areas",
,,"where modern irrigation has started (in the Upper Awash—Wonji and Metahara Sugar Estates,"
,"Merti Nura Era, Tibila and in the Middle Awash—Amibara, Kesem Sugar Estate and Gewane Cotton",
,farm) (modiﬁed and adapted from [10]).,
,,The early irrigation development was entirely initiated by joint concession with
,"companies from abroad. More speciﬁcally, irrigated sugarcane farms and factories of Wonji",
,,"(5000 ha) and Metahara (11,000 ha) commenced operation in 1954 and 1965 respectively by"
,,"bilateral agreement between the Emperial Government of Ethiopia and a Dutch company,"
,,"Hangler Vondr Amsterdam (HVA). Following the inauguration of the Koga dam in 1960,"
,several large-scale irrigation projects were developed by private companies in the whole,
,"Awash Basin. Around Merti and Jeju areas, about 1638 ha farm was developed in 1961/62",
,"by an Italian named Seignior Tiliota Santo. Both farms, Merti and Jeju, were producing",
,"cotton. Later, after the nationalization of land, both farms were merged and formed a",
,,"horticultural crops farm in 1975 which is called the Metri fruit processing plant. Then,"
,,"in 1976/77, the ﬁrst orange and mandarin orchard farms were established at Merti and Jeju,"
,respectively. Tibila irrigated farm was also nationalized in 1974 and used to grow citrus,
,"fruits, banana, avocado, and papaya. The farm was ﬁrst owned by the Haile Selassie First",
,Prince Trust Leul Ras Astrat Kassa [11].,
,,"As part of state-owned agricultural enterprise, the Amibara irrigated farm comprising"
,,"of Melka Sedi and Mekla Werer, with a total area of 10,000 ha, started operation in 1980."
,"Initially, the major industrial crop targeted was cotton, among others. In 1983, the Nura",
,Hira horticulture farm and Merti agro-industry started operation. In the rift valley lakes,
,,"basin, there were a number of concessions and estates that started operation in the early"
,,"1960s. These include Sille farm (1957), Bilate Tobacco Monopoly (1962), and Meki Ziway"
,,"(1967), among others. Later on, the Finchaa irrigated sugar estate was inaugurated in 1997."
,The chronological of the early irrigation development is summarized in Table 1.,
