Figure 3. Area equipped for medium and large-scale irrigation over three decades (source of information: plans and reports
"Before the implementation of the development plans, the expansion rate of the area"
"equipped for medium and large-scale irrigation was very slow, i.e., only 21,555 hectares"
"over 12 years. This has increased to an additional area of 77,445 hectares after the im-"
"plementation of the PASDEP. Then, after the two consecutive plans of GTP I and GTP II"
"additional irrigated area, expansion of about 127,242 and 283,084 hectares, respectively,"
"was achieved. This marks an annual expansion rate of 12.9% and 24.5%, respectively."
"As depicted in Figure 3, the total area equipped for medium and large-scale irrigation"
"by 2019 is about 539,726 hectare. However,
it must be noted that
the actual
irrigated"
"area is far less than the ﬁgure indicated here. For instance,
information collected from"
"ﬁfteen large-scale irrigation projects showed that only 34% of the 382,060 hectares of land"
potentially equipped for irrigation was actually irrigated. There were two main reasons for
"this discrepancy. (1) First, there was delay in the construction of some component parts of"
"the irrigation system, for instance, canals and ﬁeld channels, intake structures, head/cross"
"regulators, land leveling and shaping, etc. This means that there is a lack of end-to-end"
planning of projects. (2) The second reason was the malfunctioning or non-functionality
"of important canals and structures.
In most cases, dams are constructed and ﬁlled with"
"water long before the construction of conveyance and distribution canals, ﬁeld channels,"
and land preparation for irrigation are done. It is common that some years elapse until the
water reaches the ﬁeld and the provision of irrigation services commences. Due to this and
"other reasons, irrigation systems serve only a limited area, which is often less than the area"
projected during feasibility study and detail design.
"Moreover, the shrinkage of irrigation area is also attributed to many problems such as"
"lack of proper provision of farm level irrigation facilities, headwork and canal sedimenta-"
"tion, seepage through foundation, deterioration of major structural facilities, unsuitable"
"ﬁeld and canal layout and construction, missing of important hydraulic structures, shortage"
"of water, low efﬁciency, etc. [17,26,27]."
Table 2 presents the plan targets and achievements of medium and large-scale irriga-
tion development over the last one and half decades.
