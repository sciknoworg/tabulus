that needs to be developed to boost agricultural production for ensuring food security and
poverty alleviation.
"In Ethiopia, agriculture is the dominant economic sector and food supplier to the"
"nation, and it relies largely on rainfall. It contributes 43% of the GDP, about 80% of employ-"
"ment, and approximately 75% of export commodity values [6]. The vulnerability of the"
sector to rainfall amount and distribution is more pronounced as crop production domi-
nates (67%) the agricultural GDP [7]. In view of the increasing population growth and food
demand on one hand and increasing pressure on rain-fed agriculture due to land degra-
"dation and climate variability on the other, the important role of irrigation development"
"is indispensible. However, despite the recognition of the important role of irrigation in"
"minimizing the risk of crop failure due to drought and sustaining agricultural production,"
well-planned irrigation development targeting medium and large-scale schemes has started
"only two decades ago.
Just for the purpose of planning and development convenience,"
irrigation typology of Ethiopia is classiﬁed under three categories: namely as small-scale
"(<200 hectare), medium scale (200–3000 ha), and large-scale (> 3000 ha) irrigation."
"Disappointingly,
the total area under irrigation is not well known, as irrigation is"
"implemented by different actors (Federal Government, Regional Governments, Sugar"
"Corporation, Development Partners, Private Investors, and Farmer), and no one is respon-"
sible for data collection and management. The major problem in relation to the irrigation
development trend in this country is that the scant sources provide different ﬁgures re-
"lated to the extent of area under irrigation in the country, and one is not certain which"
"is more accurate. Hence, the purpose of this review work was to gather published and"
"unpublished information from relevant sources and then review, analyze, and organize the"
results in such a way that it provides historical trends and the current status of irrigation
development as well as challenges facing the sector.
2. Literatures and Procedures Used for the Review
"Modern irrigation development has relatively short history in Ethiopia. Research,"
"monitoring, and evaluation of
the development of
irrigation are rarely done. Hence,"
published materials related to irrigation development are scanty. Even irrigation-related
"facts and ﬁgures cited in different reports are different. For this review,
the following"
"materials were used:
the published articles or unpublished articles, annul and strategic"
"plans,
reports of
the Ministry of Water,
Irrigation, and Energy as well as Ministry of"
"Agriculture, proceedings of workshops and symposia, etc."
"It terms of procedures, the review was designed to provide the brief picture of his-"
torical evolution of irrigation development and management as well as the current status
and challenges facing its development. The problems of irrigation development are multi-
"faceted and interrelated; thus, they can be presented in the form of problem nest. The causes"
and effects of the major problems are discussed and improvement options are implied.
An overall summary of the review and conclusions is also provided.
3. History and Status of Irrigation Development in Ethiopia
3.1. Brief History of Irrigation Development
Cursory reports indicate that small-scale irrigation development in Ethiopia has a long
"history that probably pre-dates the Axum empire more than 2000 years ago [8]. However,"
"it might have been less important because rain-fed agriculture, terraces, and small-scale"
"irrigation were found sufﬁcient to sustain ancient populations [9].
In many parts of the"
"country, traditional irrigation that involves small-scale river diversions, recession framings,"
"and rainwater harvesting has been practiced for several years. However, greater attention"
was given to small-scale peasant-based irrigation development following the recurrent
drought and famine experienced by the country in the 1970s and 1980s as a strategy to boost
agricultural production and achieve food self-sufﬁciency [8]. Kloos H. [8] pointed out that
the government-funded initiatives of irrigation development were unsustainable partly
