"as an integral part of the organizational structure of the corporation. Thus, schemes are"
operated by unskilled and on-job trained staff with no adequate irrigation engineering
knowledge and technical skill. The visible consequences of such unwise management
"of irrigation are widespread salinity development, groundwater rise, and related water-"
logging and deterioration of soil fertility and loss of agricultural land.
"Next to the ESC, the smallholder farming community is the largest beneﬁciary of"
medium and large-scale irrigation development implemented and managed by the gov-
ernment. Such projects are used by hundreds and thousands of smallholder farmers and
jointly managed by the Irrigation Development Commission (IDC) and the users. The IDC
is responsible for water allocation and distribution through operation of the headwork
"and main system.
Irrigators are organized and form irrigation water users associations"
"(IWUAs) that are responsible for tertiary and quaternary level
irrigation management."
Local agricultural bureaus facilitate the establishment of IWUAs and with limited support
services to enhance their capacities. The major operation and maintenance works remain
"the responsibility of the government, which is not properly undertaken. There is a lack of"
coordination among these parties involved in irrigation development and management.
"Generally, irrigation development in Ethiopia has been largely focusing on infrastruc-"
ture construction. That means that the important role of irrigation management is largely
"overlooked. Consequently, several studies indicate that
the performance of
irrigation"
"schemes, measured with several applicable indicators, is poor [14–20]; While the causes for"
"low performance are diverse, it is largely attributed to inadequate management of schemes."
Not only are the productivity and efﬁciency of schemes low but also the areas irrigated are
far below the potential irrigable areas created by project implementation. Reports indicate
"that currently, about 50% of the irrigation schemes are considered as proving functional"
"services, the remaining 34% of the implemented schemes are not utilized with full capacity,"
and 16% are non-functional [21].
"In most instances, the performances of irrigation schemes implemented by the gov-"
ernment and development partners and operated either by the community or jointly
by a government body and the community are poor compared to traditional schemes.
"Solomon and Kitamura [22] studied Betmera-Hiwane, one of the ancient traditional
ir-"
"rigation schemes in Tigray, and found the management peculiarities contributing to its"
"enduring success to be the presence of communally constructed local rules, locally designed"
"hydraulic control structures, ownership feeling of the irrigators and accountability of water"
"distributors to the irrigation management, the culture for mobilizing communal resources,"
"and the culture of self-initiating local water management strategies. Sometimes, the scheme"
management decisions made by government-delegated authorities in guiding smallholder
irrigators may not yield positive results. It is important to recognize that farmers have a
better site-speciﬁc understanding of their farms and resources in the area and can make
problem-solving decisions. The authors of [23] studied farmers’ participation in the man-
agement decision making of the Gumselassa irrigation scheme in the Tigray region of
Ethiopia. Water shortage was found to be the major problem threatening the scheme. The
"government authorities advised the farmers to reduce their irrigated land, which was not"
welcomed by the users. Their study result reviled that when farmers were allowed to make
"their own decisions to solve the recurrent problems such as water shortages, they came"
up with innovative adaptation strategies to the prevailing water scarcity. With minimal
"technical supports, farmers’ collective action-based small-scale irrigation management has"
demonstrated success histories in many parts of the country.
The success of small-scale traditional irrigation has been attracting the attention of
"many farmers and even that of the government. Consequently, the number of irrigators"
and area irrigated in some small-scale schemes has increased over time [24]. The secret of
"the success lies in the indigenous knowledge used to address problems, traditional institu-"
"tional systems, and rules that are understood and respected by the community. Irrigation"
development and management in Ethiopia is highly dominated by a top–down approach
and could not beneﬁt from the golden opportunity of existing local knowledge [25]. Lack
