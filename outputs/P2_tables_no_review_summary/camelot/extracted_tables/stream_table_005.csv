"Later,
the Ministry was renamed as the Ministry of Water and Electricity in 2010"
"and the Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Energy (MoWIE) in 2015. Here,
the name ir-"
"rigation was included in the Ministry’s naming for the ﬁrst
time.
Toward the end of"
"the year 2018, the Irrigation Development Commission (IDC) was established under the"
MoWIE. The Commission has the responsibility to manage medium and large-scale irriga-
"tion projects and conduct the appropriate study, design, and construction of such projects"
on areas identiﬁed for irrigation with an overall aim of enhancing the socio-economic
"development of the country through ensuring food security,
job creation, and raw material"
supply to industries and export earnings. The Commissioner of IDC assumed its ofﬁce

and Drainage Study and Design; Irrigation and Drainage Construction Supervision; Irri-
gation Infrastructure Administration; Capacity Building and Technology; Procurement
