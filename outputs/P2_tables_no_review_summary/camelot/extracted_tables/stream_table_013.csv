"Concerning irrigation management, there is a clear vicious circle of the arc “weak man-"
agement capacity →poorly operated and maintained system →poor system performance
→low productivity→low income→weak management capacity”. Converting this vicious
circle into a virtuous circle requires building the capacity of irrigation management institu-
tions including that of irrigators’.
"Apart from the poor performances of irrigation schemes, unwise management of irri-"
gation water has been causing multitudes of undesirable consequences on the environment.
"The development of salinity, sodicity, and water-logging in many large and medium-scale"
"irrigation schemes in lowland areas of the country is increasing [13,36]. Hence, the rate at"
which the county is losing its fertile agricultural land to these unwanted consequences of
irrigation has been rising. Although there are many factors that are contributing to these
"problems, low irrigation efﬁciencies as a result of inadequate knowledge and the skill of"
"irrigators can be considered as the major factor [12,32,36]."
4.4. Other Support Services and Issues
Water application through irrigation is only one input to the agricultural production
system. Timely and reliable water supplies enhance greater cropping intensities which
when integrated with other appropriate agricultural inputs can push up agricultural pro-
ductivity [36]. The adoption of improved irrigated agricultural innovations by farmers
is believed to be of prime importance for improving farming practices that enhance the
"productivity, proﬁtability, and sustainability of
their farms.
Such innovations include"
"high-yielding varieties, new types of fertilizers, modern farm technologies and practices"
"of land and water management, and new strategies of market engagement, among oth-"
"ers [25,37–40]. While extension services are necessary to help farmers adapt and implement"
"improved practices, access to credit and market provide ﬁnancial capacity and thereby"
enable farmers to invest in improved agricultural inputs and technologies.
"However, unlike agriculture, the irrigation sector in Ethiopia is not well supported"
"by extension services. Most often,
irrigation is practiced without adequate know-how,"
"which resulted in undesirable consequences such as soil salinity, groundwater rise, water-"
"logging, and the degradation of soil fertility. Moreover, the lack of appropriate ﬁnancing"
"mechanisms and access to market has been threatening the success of irrigation, which in"
turn affected the likelihoods of irrigators and limited their capacity to invest in improved
"farm inputs and technologies [27,30,33,41]. The overall consequence is the deterioration"
of many of the irrigation systems and poor performances. The effects of low farm income
and inadequate capacity to afford improved technologies can be explained by a vicious
circle of the form “poor irrigation management combined with low use of improved farm
"inputs cause decreases in crop yields and production, which in turn leads to low income"
and ﬁnally the inability to purchase improved inputs and technologies.
"Moreover, the sustainability of irrigation systems is largely threatened by watershed"
"degradation and the resulting ﬂoods, soil erosion, and sedimentation [24].
Irrigation in-"
"frastructures such as dams, diversion headworks, and canals are frequently damaged by"
"ﬂoods, and their projected life is shortened by excessive sedimentation from the degraded"
"uplands [2,13]. Many schemes are facing water shortage due to drought and the overuse of"
"the available water, hence reducing their irrigable areas [31]."
5. Summary and Conclusions
"In this study, the irrigation development in Ethiopia, historical background, develop-"
"ment trends, current status, and challenges threatening its implementation and manage-"
"ment are reviewed, synthesized, and presented. Smallholder farmers’ own initiative and"
indigenous knowledge-based irrigation has been practiced in Ethiopia for over 2000 years.
Recognizing small-scale irrigation as an important intervention to sustain agricultural
production and thereby minimize the risk of crop failure due to drought or dry spell has
"started following the droughts of 1980 to 1984/85. Nevertheless, some private concessions"
driven by foreign interests have started modern irrigation development in Awash Basin in
