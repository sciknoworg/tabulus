,"As highlighted above, modern irrigation development started in Awash Basin more",,,
,"80 years ago. However, public investment-supported development of irrigation was partic-",,,
,"ularly stimulated following the drought and famine in 1973 and 1984. As a result, in ad-",,,
,"dition to communal irrigated farms, large numbers of state farms were created through",,,
the nationalization of most of,,the private irrigation farms in the 1970s and 1980s. Al-,,
,"though with slow pace, speciﬁcally in the 1990s, the irrigation development has continued",,,
to expand to other river basins.,,,,
3.2. Irrigation Management,,,,
,3.2.1. Evolution of Water Resources and Irrigation Management Institutions,,,
,"Similar to modern irrigation development, the water management institution has a",,,
,short history in Ethiopia. The chronological evolution of the water institutions is depicted,,,
,"in Figure 2. The ﬁrst water sector institution, Water Resources Department, was created in",,,
"1956 under the then Ministry of Public Works and Communication. Since then, the water",,,,
,sector in Ethiopia has passed through considerable institutional changes and development.,,,
,"Before a Federal Political administrative system was established in early 1991, the public",,,
,agencies involved in the water sector include the Valley Development Studies Authority,,,
,"(1962), National Water Resources Commission (1971), Ethiopian Water Resource Authority",,,
,"(1975), Valley Agricultural Development Authority (1977), and National Water Resources",,,
Commission (1981).,,,,
,"As indicated in the previous section,",the early history of,,irrigation development
,in Ethiopia was dominated by small-scale irrigation. The development of small-scale,,,
,irrigation was carried out by different institutions such as the surface water division of the,,,
,soil and water conservation department under the then Ministry of Agriculture (MoA). In,,,
"1984, the division was restructured to the Irrigation Development Department (IDD) under",,,,
,"the MoA, which was entrusted with the planning and construction of small-scale irrigation",,,
,that was mostly utilized by agricultural co-operatives [13]. With the establishment of the,,,
,Ministry of Natural Resources Development and Environmental Protection (MoNREP) in,,,
"1993, the IDD was dissolved and its responsibility transferred to MoNREP.",,,,
,"Based on the new federal administrative structure implemented in 1991, the regional",,,
,bureaus of natural resources development took over the responsibility to undertake small-,,,
,"scale irrigation development. MoNREP was dissolved in 1995, and its responsibility was",,,
,shared among MoA and the newly established Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR).,,,
"While the MoWR had a regulatory role in water resources development and management,",,,,
,"regional bureaus of Water, Mines, and Energy Resources Development were responsible",,,
,for small-scale irrigation development in their respective regions.,,,
,"Accordingly, the MoWR has facilitated the issuance of several water resources regula-",,,
,"tory frameworks, namely Water Resources Management Policy (1999), Water Resources",,,
,"Management Proclamation (2000), National Water Resources Development Strategy (2001),",,,
,"Fifteen year (2002–2016) Water Resources Development Program (2002), and Water Re-",,,
,"sources Regulation (2005). In 2005, the MoWR was restructured to encompass the energy",,,
,sector and named as the Ministry of Water and Energy (MoWE). In all these regulatory,,,
,"frameworks and development programs, irrigation expansion was given due attention.",,,
,"Under both Ministries (MoWR and MoWE), irrigation was represented by the Irrigation",,,
,"Department, which was largely responsible for the study, design, and implementation of",,,
,medium and large-scale irrigation projects.,,,
