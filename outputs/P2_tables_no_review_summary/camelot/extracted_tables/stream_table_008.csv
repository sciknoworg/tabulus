"of ownership feeling by the local community toward schemes planned,
implemented,"
and operated by government support without consultation is considered one of the many
reasons for unsustainable irrigation system.
3.3. Trends and Status of Irrigation Development in Ethiopia
"Actually, there is no ofﬁcial document that clearly shows the total area under irrigation."
Different sources provide ﬁgures that vary greatly. As indicated in the previous Section
"3.2.2, irrigation development has been undertaken by many different parties with no coor-"
dination mechanism between them. Not only the lack of functional institution for irrigation
development and management but also their frequent restructuring and instability have
been the major causes for the nonexistence of consistent records and institutional memories.
"During the pre-revolution (before 1974), the chief purpose of irrigation was to pro-"
"vide industrial crops to the growing agro-industries in the country, many of which were"
controlled by the interest of foreign companies and to boost export earnings. The main
"crops grown were sugarcane, cotton, sesame, fruit, and vegetables [13]. Following the l975"
"land reform and agricultural policies, greater emphasis was given to the development of"
large-scale state farms. This was done by converting the majority of large-scale commercial
farms owned by individuals and cooperatives into state farms (see also Section 3.1). As doc-
"umented by [8], all these reforms could not yield positive results in terms of producing"
"adequate agricultural products to feed the growing population. Moreover, the country was"
"hit by frequent drought that yearly intensiﬁed from 1980 to 1984. As a result, serious famine"
"prevailed in many regions of the country. Generally, the 1984/85 famine provided a major"
stimulus for the development of the government-sponsored small-scale irrigation program
"in areas affectively controlled by the central government, and especially in communities"
"where producer cooperatives had been established. Furthermore, the peasants have shown"
a great deal of initiative in developing irrigation schemes on their own in various parts of
"the country, which is widely known as traditional irrigation. The government, on its part,"
has also prepared and implemented the ten-year development plan to ﬁght against drought
and famine that has occurred from 1984/85 to 1993/94. One of the targets of the plan was
"to develop 57,000 hectares of land under small-scale irrigation in private and cooperative"
"farms. However, the success of this target was not evaluated due to the collapse of the"
socialist Government (the Derg regime).
The trend of irrigation development after the downfall of the Derg regime is indicated
in Figure 3. The period between 1991 and 1995 was considered as a transitional period (to
federalism) during which no signiﬁcant irrigation development activity was carried out.
It was with the issuance and implementation of a series of national economic development
plans and programs that the development of medium and large-scale irrigation showed
a signiﬁcant increase. Examples of these development programs and plans during that
"time are among others:
the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program"
"(SDPRP,
from 2002/03–2004/05); Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development
to"
"End Poverty (PASDEP, from 2005/06–2009/10); and the Growth and Transformation Plan"
"(GTP I, from 2010/11–2014/15) and GTP II, from 2015/16–2019/20.
In all these plans,"
irrigation development was given greater attention.
