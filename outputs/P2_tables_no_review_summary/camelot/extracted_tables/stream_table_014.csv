"1960s, mainly for the production of industrial crops. Although the potential of irrigation in",,
,"boosting agricultural production is widely understood, its development remained more or",
,less stagnant until 2010. This is largely due to political and institutional instability and a,
lack of clear direction for the development of the sector.,,
,The development and implementation of the five-year plans over three consecutive,
,terms brought increasingly accelerated development trend in irrigation. These plans were,
,"the Development and Poverty Reduction Program (SDPRP, from 2002/03–2004/05); Plan for",
,"Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP, from 2005/06–2009/10);",
,"and the Growth and Transformation Plans, such as GTP I, from 2010/11–2014/15 and GTP",
,"II, from 2015/16–2019/20. During the two later plan periods, medium and large-scale",
,irrigation development has registered an average annual expansion arte of 20% and 22%,
,"respectively and reached an estimated area of 539,736 hectare in the year 2019.",
,Small-scale irrigation practice to supplement rain-fed agriculture has had a long,
,history in Ethiopia. Such schemes have a number of advantages over medium and large-,
scale schemes; namely the following:,(1) they are less expensive;,(2) they are easier to
,"implement and manage and hence, provide larger opportunity for farmers’ participation;",
,(3) there is better coherence between farmers as one scheme serves a limited number of,
,"beneﬁciaries; and (4) equity can be addressed, as its implementation does not require",
,"extensive potential areas. Reportedly, the area equipped for small-scale irrigation until",
,the year 2010 was about 0.85 million hectares only. With the annual expansion rate of 35%,
,"during GTP I, the area under small-scale irrigation has reached 2.35 million hectares in the",
,"year 2014, which was followed by only a 2% annual expansion rate during GTP II.",
,"Despite the higher emphasis given to the irrigation sector, the effectiveness of its de-",
,"velopment and management is far from the desired level. In general, the major challenges",
,"facing the sector are related to (1) study and design—inadequate capacity, lack of reliable",
,"and site-speciﬁc data, lack of binding guidelines, inadequate participation of stakehold-",
,"ers; (2) construction—inadequate capacity of the client, consultants, and contractors that",
,"invariably lead to poor contractual administration, inadequate monitoring and evaluation,",
frequent design changes that result,in excessive cost and time overruns;,"(3)
irrigation"
,"management—inadequate organization and capacity of institutions, lack of technical and",
,"ﬁnancial capacity; (4) support services—lack of irrigation extension service, market access,",
and inadequate ﬁnancing mechanism for irrigation development.,,
,The inability to build the capacity of irrigation development implementing institutions,
,including the Irrigation Development Commission of the MoWIE and the inefﬁciency as a,
,result have been dearly costing the country its scarce capital resources. Exempliﬁcations,
,of such poor contact administration are the excessive cost and time overruns affecting all,
large-scale irrigation projects.,,
,"Irrigation development, in terms of expansion during the last two decades, might look",
,"encouraging, which is basically investment-driven. However, there is an increasing concern",
,due to the fact that some projects are not operating at their full capacity and many others are,
,"deteriorating due to lack of timely maintenance and hence, poor performances. While de-",
,"veloping new irrigation projects, it is also important to note that there is substantial scope to",
,"increase food production, enhance livelihoods, and reduce poverty by properly managing",
,existing irrigation schemes. This has to be done in an integrated manner that address the,
,"rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructures, putting in place appropriate institutions and",
,innovative management styles as well as improving input services to enhance irrigated,
,agricultural productivity. Management institutions and organizations need to be supported,
,"by qualiﬁed professionals, skills, and technology for efﬁcient operation and maintenance,",
,"sustainable ﬁnancial sources, and effective regulatory and enforcement mechanisms.",
