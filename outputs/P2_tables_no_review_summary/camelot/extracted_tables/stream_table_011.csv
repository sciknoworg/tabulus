4. Challenges of Irrigation Development
Irrigation in Ethiopia is facing multitudes of constraints in all phases of its develop-
"ment (project identiﬁcation, feasibility study and detail design, construction, operation, and"
management). The major problems and resulting consequences are summarized in Figure
"5. The end effects of these interconnected problems are project cost and time overrun, poor"
"scheme performances, and unsustainable irrigation."
Unresolved problems encountered during study and design could lead to design
faults that in turn affect the whole irrigation system. Failures created during design can
seldom be corrected during construction and ﬁnally inﬂuence the overall performance of
irrigation. The major problems indicated in Figure 5 are highlighted as follows:
