"British standards, and FAO–Irrigation Manuals. As a result, there is a widespread inconsis-"
tency in study and design practices across the country.
"There is little or no community consultation on project
identiﬁcation, study, and"
"design follow the top–down approach [25,29], which prevents the incorporation of users’"
special needs and indigenous farmers’ knowledge into the planning and construction of
"irrigation schemes [30]. Often, systems designed under such conditions are portrayed by"
meager quality and inappropriateness to users. Poorly designed systems are considered
as the root causes for frequent design changes and the resulting cost and time overruns.
Many research reports identiﬁed the study and design faults as among the major challenges
"of irrigation development and management in Ethiopia [16,25,26,31–35]. Such design faults"
"have wide-reaching impacts, as design documents are seldom reviewed before construction"
commences [10].
4.2. Construction
The construction of irrigation systems involves the conversion of engineering solutions
"provided in the design document to a physical reality that enables safe storage or diversion,"
"conveyance, distribution and application of water. In this regard, the selection of competent"
"consultants and contractors as well as the use of appropriate construction materials, follow-"
ing standard construction procedures etc. are essential. The major problems during this
"implementation phase are among others inadequate capacity of the client, consultants and"
"contractors that invariably lead to poor contractual administration, inadequate monitoring"
"and evaluation, frequent design changes that result in excessive cost, and time overruns."
The study conducted by [34] on ten large-scale irrigation projects in Ethiopia showed
"that 78% of the reasons for project cost overrun were attributed to design, scope, and qual-"
ity changes. The authors also found that the average time overrun in irrigation project
"implementation is about 145%, which has direct and indirect cost implications. The authors"
of Ref. [34] also did an assessment of ten large-scale irrigation dam projects and found
"an aggregate average cost and time overrun of 176% and 151%, respectively. For a poor"
"country such as Ethiopia, such inefﬁciency in project implementation has wide-reaching"
"consequences.
Reasons for such wasteful resource use were found to be incomplete"
"design, design change, scope and quality change, poor construction time estimate, con-"
"structors’ low capacity, client’s inactions, and shortage of material."
The IAG [10] also conducted an assessment on the effectiveness of contact administra-
tion on two large-scale irrigation projects (Megech-Seraba and Zarema May-Day in Tigray
Region in Ethiopia) that are under construction. It was found that the poor performance
of these projects was partly attributable to weak institutional capacities of implementing
"bodies including the Ministry of Water, Irrigation, and Energy, which were characterized"
"by slow decision-making processes, inadequate monitoring and evaluation, and weak con-"
tract administration and coordination capacity. As long as institutional capacity remains
"inadequate, it seems unlikely that the next large-scale project will be timely and successful,"
leading to the same pitfalls in different projects [29].
4.3. Irrigation System Management
"The provision of irrigation service involves collective actions, which are the results of"
effective communication and coordination among users and service providers. In addition
"to having functional physical infrastructures in place, management institutions are also"
required. They are responsible for the mobilization of resources required for the effective
"operation of irrigation systems, making proper decisions on water diversions, equitable"
"distribution, and maintenance as well as resolving conﬂicts. The sustainability and pro-"
ductivity of irrigation system depends on the capacity of the management organization to
deliver these responsibilities.
Tertiary-level management is commonly carried out by irrigation water users associa-
"tions (IWUAs). However, such organizations are not well established and lack technical and"
"ﬁnancial capacities to properly discharge their duties of irrigation management [22,25,35]."
