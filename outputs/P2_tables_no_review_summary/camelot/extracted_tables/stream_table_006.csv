There are also federal and regional subsidiary enterprises that have been widely
"engaging in the study, design supervision, and construction of irrigation projects. The major"
"ones are Ethiopian Construction, Design and Supervision Works Corporation, Regional"
"Enterprises such as Water Works Design, and Supervision Enterprise and Water Works"
Construction Enterprise.
"In general, water resources and irrigation management instructions are characterized"
"by frequent restructuring that
involved also the movement of human and physical re-"
sources. Institutional instability causes staff frustrations that might lead to migration (staff
"turnover) and lack of interest to join the institution. In all these courses, important institu-"
"tional memories including project documents are lost, threatening the overall development"
of the sector.
3.2.2. State of Irrigation Management
"In addition to the federal institutions highlighted in the previous section, the regional"
"states have been engaging in the development and management of
irrigation in their"
"respective regions through appropriate organs. For this purpose, many regional states"
"have established irrigation development authorities toward the end of
the 1990s (for"
"example, Oromia Irrigation Development Authority in 2000 for Oromia Region in Ethiopia)."
Other regions had also similar authorities or bureaus to deal with irrigation development
"activities in their respective regions, speciﬁcally small-scale and to some extent medium-"
scale irrigation projects. These authorities and bureaus have also undergone frequent
"restructuring in a similar fashion as that of federal level institutions. Currently, the irrigation"
"development activities of the regions are carried out by Regional Water, Irrigation, and"
Energy Development Bureaus. While these bureaus jointly with regional water works
design and supervision enterprises and regional water works construction enterprises are
"actively engaging in the study, design, and construction of irrigation projects, bureaus"
of regional and zonal agriculture are responsible for providing irrigation management
support services to farmers.
Medium and large-scale irrigation schemes are developed to serve three categories of
users and operators. These are (1) the Ethiopian Sugar Corporation (ESC) for sugarcane
production and processing; (2) private investors for the production of commercial crops;
and (3) smallholder farms for subsistence farming and surplus production to be marketed.
"However, the involvement of private investors in the irrigation sector remained low due"
"to the high investment cost of irrigation development. Hence,
irrigation infrastructure"
development such as dams and big canals are carried out largely by the government within
the framework of its political and socio-economic development policies and programs.
Following the increasing demand for sugar production in the country both for do-
"mestic and export markets, more and more emphasis was given to the expansion of sugar"
"factories and sugarcane production during the last decade. To address the demand, the ESC"
was established in 2010 as autonomous government enterprise to manage the production
"and processing of sugarcane. At present, the ESC is managing some 160,921 hectares of"
irrigated land for sugarcane production distributed over eight projects area located in
"different potential areas of the Ethiopia (Wonji Showa, Metahara, Fichaa, and Arjo Didessa"
"projects in Oromia Region, Kesem project in Afar Region, Omo Kuraz project in the region"
"of Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR) and Tana Beles project in"
"Ahmara Region, and Wolkit project in Tigray Region). While some of these sugar estates"
"are old, others are operating far below their design capacities due to excessive delays in the"
"installation of factories and construction of irrigation infrastructures. In total, some 300,000"
"hectare irrigation command area is operated by the ESC, which is more than 50% of the"
total irrigated area under medium and large-scale projects in the country.
"However, the growing concern about schemes operated by the ESC is that focus has"
been given to sugarcane agronomy only and without due consideration for irrigation
"management. Once implemented, all projects including the old schemes have never"
experienced substantial rehabilitation. There is a lack of considering irrigation management
