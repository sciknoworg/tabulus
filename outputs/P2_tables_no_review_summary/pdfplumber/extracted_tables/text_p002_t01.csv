In Ethiopia, agriculture is the dominant economic sector and food supplier to the
nation,anditrelieslargelyonrainfall. Itcontributes43%oftheGDP,about80%ofemploy-

Disappointingly, the total area under irrigation is not well known, as irrigation is
implemented by different actors (Federal Government, Regional Governments, Sugar
Corporation,DevelopmentPartners,PrivateInvestors,andFarmer),andnooneisrespon-

Modern irrigation development has relatively short history in Ethiopia. Research,
monitoring, and evaluation of the development of irrigation are rarely done. Hence,
