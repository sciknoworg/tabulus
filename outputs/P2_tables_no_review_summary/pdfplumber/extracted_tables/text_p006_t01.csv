3.2.2. StateofIrrigationManagement

Inadditiontothefederalinstitutionshighlightedintheprevioussection,theregional
states have been engaging in the development and management of irrigation in their
respective regions through appropriate organs. For this purpose, many regional states
have established irrigation development authorities toward the end of the 1990s (for
example,OromiaIrrigationDevelopmentAuthorityin2000forOromiaRegioninEthiopia).

actively engaging in the study, design, and construction of irrigation projects, bureaus
of regional and zonal agriculture are responsible for providing irrigation management
